Fears grew on July 9, 2025, that the death toll of 110 in the Texas floods could still surge as hopes fade of finding survivors among the many reported still missing several days after the disaster. More than 170 people remain unaccounted for after the flash flooding on the Fourth of July holiday, a tragedy that shocked many Americans. Camp Mystic, an all-girls camp located next to the Guadalupe River, confirmed that 27 girls and counselors at the summer camp died in the flooding.
